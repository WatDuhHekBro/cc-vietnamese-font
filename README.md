# cc-vietnamese-font
A simple [CCLoader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader) mod adding support for extra characters from Vietnamese to the base font. Uses [Localize Me](https://github.com/L-Sherry/Localize-me) to handle font patching. Make sure to download from the "Releases" tab, where there should be a `.ccmod` file.
